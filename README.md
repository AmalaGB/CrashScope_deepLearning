# CrashScope_deepLearning
CrashScope is an AI-powered car damage detection and classification system. Using deep learning and computer vision, it accurately identifies different types of damages from vehicle images — such as dents, broken headlights, damaged windshields, and more — making it useful for insurance assessment, vehicle inspection, and fleet management.

📌 Features
Detects multiple types of car damages from a single image

Built using YOLOv8 for real-time object detection

Includes performance evaluation metrics (Precision, Recall, mAP, F1 Score, Accuracy)

Supports batch testing and result logging

Containerized using Docker for easy deployment
